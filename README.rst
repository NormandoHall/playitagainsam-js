JavaScript player for playitagainsam terminal sessions.

It's currently GPL'd, because it uses GPL'd code from shellinabox.com.
The file "jschannel.js" is MPL1.1/GPL2.0/LGPL2/1 triple licensed.

More licensing detials will be fleshed out here soon.  I am hoping to
get explicit permission from the shellinabox.com author to distribute
this under the MIT or similar license.
